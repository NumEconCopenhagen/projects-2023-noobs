This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **source DST** on **PRIS111 and AUS07** and show that the consumer price index for beer is a worse alternative to depict the traditional Philips Curve.
3. Model project. We model Hotelling's Linear city, where we extend this model by looking at the case where the firms are fully differentiated.
