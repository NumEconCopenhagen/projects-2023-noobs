# Model analysis project

Our project focuses on the **Hotelling Linear City Model** which involves firms choosing their location on a linear city by considering the distribution of consumers and their transportation costs.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Hotelling.ipynb](Hotelling.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
